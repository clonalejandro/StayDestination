# StayDestination
- Task: https://stay-app.notion.site/stay-app/Prueba-T-cnica-React-Native-cfc721ac6a0547ac9c7cb8e684c57f83

## Project Installation 🧑🏻‍💻

- To install this project, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
- After that, you can execute `yarn start`, and in the React Native Menu, you can select your device.


## Things to know 📝

- In the `.env` file, we have some environment variables like the app language to select the `translatableName` field and the Api url...


## Misc 🎨

- I could have configured the absolute paths, added some tests, and documented this a little better, but this is what I managed given my limited free time. I hope you appreciate the approach to the code and the architecture.
